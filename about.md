I am a fifth year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ucla.edu/) at UCLA. My advisor is Andrea Bertozzi. My research focuses on subgraph matching methods, with applications to knowledge graphs and adversarial activity detection.

I graduated from NJIT in 2016 with a BS degree in [Mathematical Sciences](https://math.njit.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cs.njit.edu/). During my last year, I interned with [Trillium Labs](https://www.trlm.com/) in equity market analysis and visualization. In 2017, I worked with the data science team at [Neural Analytics](http://www.neuralanalytics.com/), designing and implementing software for data-driven dynamic robotic control of trans-cranial Doppler ultrasound probes. In 2019, I worked at [HRL Laboratories](https://www.hrl.com), developing and testing mathematically provable safe controllers for autonomous vehicles using formal methods and differential dynamic logic.
