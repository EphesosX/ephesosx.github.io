I am a third year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ucla.edu/) at UCLA. My advisor is Andrea Bertozzi.

I graduated from NJIT in 2016 with a BS degree in [Mathematical Sciences](https://math.njit.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cs.njit.edu/). During my last year, I interned with [Trillium Labs](https://www.trlm.com/) in equity market analysis and visualization. More recently, I interned with the data science team at [Neural Analytics](http://www.neuralanalytics.com/).
